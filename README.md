# Garbage Detection Robot Arm

This project involves a garbage detection robot arm that can classify different types of waste and sort them into corresponding bins. The system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify the type of garbage and control the robot arm accordingly.

## Overview

The garbage detection robot arm consists of two main components: a computer vision system for waste classification and a robot arm for sorting the garbage into bins. The system operates as follows:

1. **Computer Vision System**: A camera captures the live video feed of the waste items placed in front of it. The computer vision system analyzes the video frames to identify the type of garbage using a pre-trained machine learning model.

2. **Waste Classification**: The computer vision system processes each frame using the pre-trained machine learning model to classify the waste into different categories such as metal, plastic, mix, and organic. The model provides a class label corresponding to the detected waste type.

3. **Robot Arm Control**: Based on the detected waste type, the robot arm performs the necessary actions to sort the garbage into the appropriate bins. The robot arm is equipped with servo motors that enable precise movement and positioning. The arm's movements are controlled using commands sent via a serial connection.

4. **Sorting Process**: The robot arm moves to the designated bin based on the detected waste type. It picks up the waste item using a gripper mechanism and deposits it into the corresponding bin. The robot arm's movements are programmed to ensure accurate sorting and efficient placement of the waste items.

## Requirements

To replicate this project, you will need the following components and software:

- Robot Arm: A robotic arm with servo motors capable of precise movement and gripping functionality.
- Camera: A camera module or webcam to capture the live video feed of the waste items.
- Computer: A computer or embedded system with sufficient processing power to run the computer vision system and control the robot arm.
- Software Libraries: The following software libraries are required:
  - OpenCV: Used for image and video processing, including capturing video frames from the camera.
  - TensorFlow: Provides the machine learning framework to load and use the pre-trained waste classification model.
  - cvzone: A computer vision library that includes helpful functions for overlaying images and text on video frames.
  - Serial: Enables serial communication between the computer and the robot arm.

## Implementation

The implementation of the garbage detection robot arm involves the following steps:

1. **Camera Setup**: Connect the camera module or webcam to the computer and ensure it is functioning correctly. Adjust the camera's position and settings to capture a clear and well-lit view of the waste items.

2. **Robot Arm Setup**: Connect the robot arm to the computer via a serial connection. Ensure that the servo motors are properly connected and can be controlled using the provided software library.

3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model to classify different types of waste. The model should be trained on a dataset that includes examples of metal, plastic, mix, and organic waste. Save the trained model and generate a corresponding labels file.

4. **Software Integration**: Write a software program that integrates the camera, waste classification model, and robot arm control. The program should capture video frames from the camera, process them using the waste classification model, and send commands to the robot arm to sort the waste accordingly.

5. **Bin Images**: Prepare images of the bins corresponding to each waste type. These images will be overlaid on the video frames to indicate the destination bin for each waste item.

6. **Real-time Operation**: Run the software program and observe the real-time operation of the garbage detection robot arm. Ensure that the waste items are correctly classified, and the robot arm performs the sorting process accurately.

## Usage

To use the garbage detection robot arm, follow these

 steps:

1. Power on the computer and ensure that the camera and robot arm are connected and functioning correctly.

2. Run the software program that integrates the camera, waste classification model, and robot arm control. This program will capture the video feed from the camera, process it using the waste classification model, and control the robot arm's movements.

3. Place the waste items in front of the camera, ensuring they are clearly visible and well-lit. The computer vision system will analyze the video frames and classify the waste into metal, plastic, mix, or organic.

4. Observe the robot arm's movements as it sorts the waste items into the corresponding bins. The arm will pick up each waste item and deposit it into the appropriate bin based on the waste type detected.

5. Monitor the system's performance and ensure that the waste items are accurately classified and sorted. Make any necessary adjustments to the software program or hardware components to improve the system's efficiency and accuracy.

## Conclusion

The garbage detection robot arm is a sophisticated system that combines computer vision, machine learning, and robotics to automate the waste sorting process. By accurately identifying the waste type and controlling the robot arm's movements, the system enables efficient and precise garbage sorting. This technology has the potential to streamline waste management processes and contribute to environmental sustainability efforts.
